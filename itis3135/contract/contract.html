        <p>
            I, Logan Z. Honker agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my FALL 2024, ITIS3135, Web App Design &lt& Development with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it&&#39;s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates&#39; code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates. Signed: Logan Z. Honaker, 05 SEP 2024
