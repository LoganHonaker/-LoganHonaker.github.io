                    <b>Design:</b>  Color palette contrast is very good and the website is very easy to navigate. Seperate .css nad .js files are present. Page follows CRAP principles, although the alignment should be adjusted on pages outside of the home page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Page Has Within It:</b>
                    <li><b>Header</b> is present as a div and implements dynamic navigation approprately, but is not within a header element itself. Imported dynamic code is within a footer element.</li>
                    <li><b>Main</b> is present and follows proper principles.</li>
                    <li><b>Footer</b> is present as a div and implements dynamic navigation approprately, but is not within a footer element.</li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Header element is not present. Brand/company name is an h1 element within main.</li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Main does contain the name of the page, but within an h1 element instead of an h2.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Brand tagline is not present on the website. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Page has footer with:</b>
                    <li><b>Menu for user's pages</b> is not present, but not necessary for this particular assignment per assingment rubric.</li>
                    <li><b>Validation links</b> are not present.</li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Page has:</b>
                    <li><b>Fully functional HTML and CSS code.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Entry or home page</b> is present and follows assignment requirements.</li>
                    <li><b>Navigation Bar</b> is present, however, it covers some text on the page.</li>
                    <li><b>Other pages</b> are present.</li>
                </p>

            Note: I could not find a clearly labeled "Client" folder, so I evaluated what I assumed to be the client project after reviewing what code is present on GitHub.
