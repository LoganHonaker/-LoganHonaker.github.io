                    <b>Design:</b> Color palette contrast is very good and the website is very easy to navigate. Seperate .css nad .js files are present. Page follows CRAP principles, although the alignment should be adjusted on pages outside of the home page. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Page Has Within It:</b>
                    <li><b>Header</b> is present.</li>
                    <li><b>Main</b> is not present.</li>
                    <li><b>Footer</b> is not present.</li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Header element is present. 
                    <li>header class="header" is not necessary for targeting within .css, which is what I assume this is for. Instead, you can target this specific header by using || #project header { whatver you want to do here } and using a regular header element.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Main does not contain the name of the page, but is within the header element.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Brand tagline is not present on the website. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Page has footer with:</b>
                    <li>Footer is not present.</li>
                    <li><b>Menu for user's pages</b> is not present, but not necessary for this particular assignment per assingment rubric.</li>
                    <li><b>Validation links</b> are not present.</li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Page has:</b>
                    <li><b>Fully functional HTML and CSS code.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Entry or home page</b> is present and follows assignment requirements, although the images do not load.</li>
                    <li><b>Navigation Bar</b> is present, however, it covers some text on the "other" pages.</li>
                    <li><b>Other pages</b> are present.</li>
                </p>

    <footer>
        <div data-include="itis3135\components\footer.html"></div>

            Note: I could not find a clearly labeled "Client" folder, so I evaluated what I assumed to be the client project after reviewing what code is present on GitHub.
