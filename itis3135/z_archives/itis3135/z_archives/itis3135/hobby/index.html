        <!-- About Section -->
        <section id="about" class="section">
          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hi, I'm Logan Honaker, and I'm passionate about gaming. Here is a bit about my journey and experience.</p>
          <p> I started playing video games at a young age. In the beginning, my only experience was simple phone games on flip phones, such as snake or tetris. This was only in spare instances where my parents could tell I was bored of whatever we were doing at the time. Most of my childhood I spent playing outside with the neighborhood kids or in recreational/school sports.</p>
          <p>Around middle school is when I got more into what people today would consider "real" video games. The first consoles I remember playing on were the Wii and PlayStation 2. When I would come home after school in the time between finishing what homework I had left and bedtime, I would play video games when no one was around to do anything else. The earliest games I remember playing were Spyro, Ratchet and Clank, and RockBand.</p>
          <p>In the past few years I've switched from console gaming to PC gaming. This change has opened up more options to me for gaming. While I do still enjoy console-exclusive games such as God of War or Pokemon, PC gaming is easier for me as I can control all aspects of my hardware.</p>

          <h2>Best Times</h2>
          <p>Learn the best times to engage in gaming throughout the year for the best experience!</p>
          <p>Some of the best times to game are those times where you can play with your friends. For some people, it is not realistic to be able to play games all day long. When you have a group of friends to play with, games become more enjoyable as you get the opportunity to talk and socialize with people over a medium all members are in agreement on. Also, some of the best times gaming comes with friends, as they remove repition from some activities.</p>
          <p>While some people may not find that answer satifactory, in reality, the best time to game is when you can. By this I mean that all of your real-world duties and tasks have been accomplished such as work, errands, chores, and schoolwork. In some cases, you may become overhwhelmed in the amount of tasks you have to accomplish. In times like these, gaming can provide a simple mental break by taking your mind off everything that worries you. The key to this is to no get sucked in for hours at a time, and to resume your normal responsibilies.</p>

        <!-- Best Locations Section -->
        <section id="locations" class="section">
          <h2>Best Locations</h2>
          <p>The best locations for gaming can be argued upon. Many different factors correlate to the best gaming experince, and some of them are pure personal choices.</p>
          <p>In terms of connectivity, the best place to game is one where you have the best connection to the internet. Currently, this means having access to fiber internet. This will reduce overall lag and connection times, so long as your hardware is able to fully utilize fiber.</p>
          <p>In some other terms, the best place to game is where you feel most comfortable. This includes your physical location, and how you set up your gaming area. Many people prefer to either play games in their living room, bedroom, or in a dedicated office/gaming room. Many people spend a lot of time, effort, and money into making sure their gaming area is exactly how they want it to be. Changing things such as ligthing, the type of monitor or desk you use, how comfortable the couch is, etc. make up a lot of the comfortability of gaming.</p>
          <p>In terms of obtaining games to play with friends, you can do this from your respective platform's store. This includes the PlayStation Store, Xbox Store, and Steam, among others.</p>
          <p>Today, most consoles and PC's do not have a disk drive, but there is still the option to add this onto your gaming system, typically for a higher price.</p>

        <!-- How To Section -->
        <section id="how" class="section">
          <h2>How To</h2>
          <p>Getting started with gaming is as simple as downloading a game from the app store on your phone. There are many mobile games that people play to fill gaps in their daily schedule. These games can be easy to forget about for a while and come back to, or require daily attention in order to progress properly. This is also likely the most available option, as most people today have a smartphone.</p>
          <p>Other methods to get into gaming is finding out what games your friends play. This helps to choose your platform of gaming as well. More recently, gaming has become an ever increasing investment, as computer component prices have risen over time. Console gaming is the most likely route people will choose, as the overall cost is lower and is the most prevalent. PC gaming can also be around the same price bracket, but can easily reach into the tens of thousands of dollars if you are trying to build one of the best PCs on the market.</p>

          <h2>Why</h2>
          <p>Discover why gaming is worth your time and how it brings joy, relaxation, and personal growth.</p>
          <p>So why should you game? Well, it's totally up to you on if you do or not. Some people enjoy it, and other hate it. So here is a list of reasons I believe one should pick up gaming.</p>
          <li>You get to spend time with friends you may not be able to physcially meet up with.</li>
          <li>You get to spend time in the comfort of your home.</li>
          <li>Some games are made to be relaxing, helping to reduce overall stress.</li>
          <li>Other games are purely competitive, which is a great way to socialize and make new friends.</li>
          <li>Story-driven games are a unique type of medium. Where books, movies, and TV are all very popular mediums, some stories are best delivered in gaming where the player can create their own story based on their choices.</li>
